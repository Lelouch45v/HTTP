    <td>Gustave Flaubert</td>
    <td>For daring to peer into the heart of an adulteress and enumerate 
its contents with profound dispassion, the author of Madame Bovary 
was tried for "offenses against morality and religion." What shocks 
us today about Flaubert's devastatingly realized tale of a young 
woman destroyed by the reckless pursuit of her romantic dreams is 
its pure artistry: the poise of its narrative structure, the opulence 
of its prose (marvelously captured in the English translation of 
Francis Steegmuller), and its creation of a world whose minor 
figures are as vital as its doomed heroine.</td>
